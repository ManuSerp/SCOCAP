Spacecraft Orbit Calculator Program, side project for fun

Celestial boyd -> hardcoded ellipsoidal movement for the moment Around the center. Meaning if you choose earth as 0.0 then you can only add celestial body orbiting earth. meaning if you do a solar system you cant model planet's moon by celestial body. The updater of planet trajectory will need a big to work to allow a random origin

Force computing -> sum here the force of all body and then nothing change
